# Personal-

requirements of this blog website are as follows:
- Give me a way to display my blog posts to everyone who comes to my site.
- Give me a way to enter my blog posts so that only I can add them.
----
Now, I don’t want to have to write HTML in my blog posts. Could you give me a way to write my
posts in an editor like Word?
----
I need to categorize my blog posts. And since this is a #hashtag #crazy
#world, I probably should have some way to tag my posts with multiple tags as well.
----
I need a way to add static pages. Again, I want the world to view the pages, but only I can write
these pages. Remember, I don’t like writing straight HTML at the end of the day, so if you can
hook me up with an editor that lets me write rich text and post images, that would be awesome. 
---
also created a security measure for users to log in and have a password encryption system.
